These stored hashed password would then be used as parts of password based authentication system. For years hashing has been the accepted standards when it comes to using and storing passwords. Using hashing functions for storing passwords does have its problems though. Hash functions like MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 are general purpose hash functions designed to calculate a message digest of large amount of data in the shortest time possible. This means they are excellent in ensuring the integrity of data but they are not very good for storing passwords. As CPU's and GPU's are getting faster attacker can write code to make recovering hashed password easier and quicker. A salt in a password does give some protection against these attack but we should not rely on it. It is still vulnerable to brute force attacks where attacker can try out every possible key combination till they hit upon the correct one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to add another layer of security, we can also define how many times the hashing function run or to put it another way how many iterations will it have. Adding more iterations makes the hashing function slower. So the question why in the world would we want to intentionally slowdown our function. It is because a slower function is more immune to brute force attacks since it will take longer to test out each possible key combination. This makes brute force attacks slower and therefore so much more difficult to pull off successfully. Hence when it comes to password hashing, slower is strangely enough better. \n",

We will first hash the name with sha-256, which is then followed by hashing with sha-512 on the hashed version of the name. One important thing we need to make sure is that the hashing technique is highly sensitive to case of the string. By just changing a single letter in the string from upper case to lower case, it changes the hash value completely. Hence, in this work, we are converting the string into lower case before applying hashing technique. For the `Email` column, we will be requiring only the domain name for the analysis. Hence first we apply the split method in order to just keep the domain name for the corresponding emails in the dataset, followed by merging the string name as one.  "
