# Operate First Community Meetup

The Operate First Community Meetup is a biweekly event open to everyone interested in learning more about how various individuals, teams, projects, and online communities are working towards democratizing the development of open operations under the principles and ideas of Operate First (Operate, Open, Governance, and Hybrid).

This meetup aims to embrace the multi-disciplinary nature of the current state of operations and cloud infrastructure by covering technical topics relevant to DevOps, data scientists, SREs, software engineers, and alike. And all in an open public forum.
